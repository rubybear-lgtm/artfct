# Railway configuration

> **Do not run `railway config apply` against production (RUB-466).** `railway.ts` declares only the staging services (`staging-web`, `staging-scheduler`, `staging-queue`, `staging-polis`, `Postgres-XPCc`, `Postgres`) and does not export `partial`. Omitted resources are deletions, so applying it to production would plan deleting production `web`, `queue`, `scheduler`, `Postgres-tsII` and its volume. `railway config plan` is read-only and still safe to run. Lift this freeze only after the file covers both environments (or is scoped with `partial`) and a production plan shows no deletes.

This project defines its Railway infrastructure in code.

```txt
.railway/railway.ts
```

Use this file to describe the Railway project you want: services, databases, buckets, custom domains, replicas, groups, and environment variables.

The TypeScript file imports `railway/iac`. Install the SDK from the repository root:

```bash
npm install railway
```

## Common commands

Create the configuration files:

```bash
railway config init
```

Import an existing Railway project into code:

```bash
railway config pull
```

Preview what Railway would change:

```bash
railway config plan
```

Apply the planned changes:

```bash
railway config apply
```

## Notes

- `railway config plan` is safe and does not change Railway.
- `railway config apply` previews changes and asks before applying unless you pass `--yes`.
- Destructive changes in non-interactive or agent sessions require `railway config apply --confirm-destructive` after reviewing the plan.
- CI should pin a plan (`railway config plan --out railway-plan.json`) and apply that file on merge (`railway config apply --plan railway-plan.json --yes --confirm-destructive`) so the reviewed change set is what lands. On GitHub Actions, use https://github.com/railwayapp/config.
- Services already managed by `railway.json` must be migrated before `.railway/railway.ts` can manage them.
- Keep one `.railway` file for the whole project. A named `export const partial` (or `PARTIAL` / `const Partial`) is a last resort for separate repos that cannot share that file. Do not add it unless omit=delete across repos is a blocker.
- Use `replicas` for scaling; advanced placement can still specify region names.
- Use `group("Name", [resources])` to keep large projects organized on the Railway canvas.
- Secrets imported from Railway are rendered as `preserve()` so existing values are retained without writing secret values to source. Use `railway config pull --omit-preserved-variables` for a smaller import. `railway config pull --include-variables` decrypts and inlines non-sealed values (including secrets that were never sealed).
- `railway config migrate` finds every `railway.json` / `railway.toml` in the repository and writes them into this one file.
